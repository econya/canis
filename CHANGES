Made some changes in getchar to return STRINGS but not implemented. Evaluating benefits
in moving to chars, and how to go about.

2014-04-23 - 00:23 

removed many dead methods from window and some from widget
slight changes in button and label : when_form replaced by FORM_ATTACHED

2014-05-05 - 20:12 

- moved to new cleaner method of reading keys from keyboard
- Added ButtonGroup for RadioButtons.
- removed Bottomline and enhanced rcommandline instead

- introduced layouts. Now a user can hardcode locations of widgets or use a layout
  to do the same. A layout is able to handle a resize of the screen.

- Major rewrite of colorparser. now colors are not hardcoded while parsing. We now store link
  to parent chunk, so that a change in textpads color can affect the pad without a re-parse.
  Parent's color's are resolved at render time.

- minor changes that could result in some color related issues with buttons or other widgets
  - repaint in various widgets no longer sets @bgcolor and @color, it uses the method
    Same with @attr. messagebox also does not set the color variables but uses the method
  - clear_pad clear_row uses content_cols i/o width so complete pad is cleared.
    Also i have put a return in the middle, i think the second part of clear is redundant
    now, if the first half works properly.
