# Canis

ncurses library for ruby with essential components/controls only

Things are looking better now. Textpad seems to be more or less stable as far 
as changes are concerned

## Installation

    gem install canis

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

Please note that the *TextPad* class which is a parent to all multi-line widgets is still in flux.
I am still trying to simplify it, esp the colored chunk part , so that this class can be frozen.
