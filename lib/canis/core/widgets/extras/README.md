Pls use the objects in this dir with care. 
Pls test them thoroughly, these are largely minimally tested
items or utilities that may be of help but are not critical to
a minimal toolkit. 

These will only be updated if a bug is pointed out, or a pull request / patch is sent.


It may be preferable to copy these into your application and make whatever changes you want.
