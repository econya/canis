# Help for Textpads 

(These were earlier called _TextViews_ )

Textpads allow display of multiline textual information and provide for 
basic search, and vim-like navigation keys.

Some textpads are extended to display multiple buffers such as the help
screens. Textpads may display text that has ANSI escape codes such as 
unix `man` pages, or the output of commands such as `ri` or `dooby` or 
any other unix command that outputs colored output.

There is a second format that provides a lot more control than ANSI,
which is a `tmux` like format. This is used in the `status_line`.

Finally, there is a (new) help format, much like markdown (very
restricted, though). This page is formatted using the help format.

Following are some styles it provides:

- strong using __ as in __strong__. end
- strong using double asterisks that is ** : **strong text with spaces**. end
- emphasis using single asterisk * as in *emphasis*. end.
  Emphasis *taking spaces in* between with single asterisk.
- emphasis using single _ as in _thisisemphsized_, will not take _
inside.
- code using tilde as in `do_process_now` or `@bgcolor` and `$fgcolor`.
- underline using bar as in |underlined|, this depends on TERM setting.
  xterm shows underlines, most others do not.
- Link as in [[list]] (double brackets in source, but single in display).
- key using angular brackets as in <KEY_BACKSPACE>.

A block follows in white and bold (start with a single > on previous
line, and end with a single < char after block:
>
 I think most of these need to be fixed so they don't start capturing
 if surrounded by spaces. A lookahead and lookbehind is required other
 wise they can wreak havoc.

Textpads do not provide row selection, but do allow mapping of the <ENTER>
key and provide the `word_under_cursor` to the calling block as part of
the action event. For instance, on this (or other) help pages, pressing 
the <TAB> key will take the cursor to the next link (if there is one).
Pressing <ENTER> on the link will open the linked help file. This is the
link to the [[index]] or main help page.
