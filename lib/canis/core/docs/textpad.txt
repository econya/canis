# Help for Textpads 

(These were earlier called _TextViews_ )

Textpads allow display of multiline textual information and provide for 
basic search, and vim-like navigation keys.

Some textpads are extended to display multiple buffers such as the help
screens. Textpads may display text that has ANSI escape codes such as 
unix `man` pages, or the output of commands such as `ri` or `dooby` or 
any other unix command that outputs colored output.

There is a second format that provides a lot more control than ANSI,
which is a `tmux` like format. This is used in the `status_line`.

Finally, there is a (new) help format, much like markdown (very
restricted, though). This page is formatted using the help format.

Textpads do not provide row selection, but do allow mapping of the <ENTER>
key and provide the `word_under_cursor` to the calling block as part of
the action event. For instance, on this (or other) help pages, pressing 
the <TAB> key will take the cursor to the next link (if there is one).
Pressing <ENTER> on the link will open the linked help file. This is the
link to the [[index]] or main help page.
