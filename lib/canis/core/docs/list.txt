# Help for Lists

Lists support selection, either single or multiple. 

Single selecion is done using "v" which is the visual mark key in vim.
In multiple selection, the "v" may be used to select multiple rows. 
The "V" character may be used for range selection.

Lists also provide for inversion of selection (*), select all (a) and clear selection  (u). 
These bindings may have been modified by your individual application.

*Ask_select* and *Ask_Unselect* may be mapped for certain applications
allowing a user to give a pattern to select or unselect. 

Lists support all other motion commands of [[Textpad]].
