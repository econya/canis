# Help for Tables

Tables are multirow components that support columnar information.

Columns may be resized, or hidden. Keys for this will have to be defined
by the application, if appropriate.

Data may be sorted on column by pressing <ENTER> on the header, if the 
default table sorter has been enabled, or a custom sorter defined.

Tables support all or most motion commands of [[Textpad]].

Tables may be configured to support selection capabilities of [[List]] 
if required.

Some basic row addition and editing facilities are also provided, which
must be bound to a key, if the application allows editing. It is
expected that an application will customize the basic row editing
feature for its needs.
