# Help for TabbedPanes

TabbedPanes allow multiple forms to occupy one area on the screen.
Following are some keys useful on a tabbedpane:
<

    <TAB>   -   navigate between tabs or components
    <DOWN>  -   navigate to the components of a tab
    <UP>    -   navigate between components on a tab
                or back to the the tabs
    <SPACE> -   activate the tab under cursor
                Earlier, <ENTER> would have worked, but now
                <ENTER> only fires the default button an a page.
