# Help for Trees

Trees are multirow components that support tree-like information, with
leafs and branches (nodes) that contain more leafs or branches.

These are often used for directory-like structures.

Trees support all or most motion commands of [[Textpad]] in addition to
defining some additional ones.

Pressing <ENTER> expands or collapses a node (branch).
The `$row_selector` key by default is "v" which is used to trigger a
method, such as displaying details on some other list or view.
